Writeup a documentation of your project on your GitHub account by editing the README file, and including the following:
- Project Name
- Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.
- Process: How did you go about implementing the concept. Describe your role and what your contribution was.
- Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
