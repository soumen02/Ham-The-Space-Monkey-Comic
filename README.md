Process:
Creating a 6-panel interactive comic using 2D software such as Adobe Illustrator and/or Photoshop was an interesting challenge that required careful planning, creativity, and attention to detail. Our group's story, "Ham-The Space Monkey" added an extra layer of excitement and fun to the project.

One of the first steps we took as a group was to brainstorm ideas for our comic's story and interactivity features. We discussed possible plot lines, characters, settings, and interactive elements that would make our comic engaging and entertaining for the audience. We also considered different ways to present the story on a web page and how to use technology to enhance the user experience.

Once we had a clear idea of what we wanted to portray, we started working on the actual content of the comic. We used Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, as well as the AI drawing application "Midjourney" and an iPad app called Procreate to create our protagonist Ham and other background arts, combining original drawings, photos and mixed media elements. We paid close attention to the composition, color, and visual narrative of each panel, making sure that the story flowed smoothly and the characters were well-developed.

We also added interactivity features to our comic, such as sound effects, animations, and clickable options that allowed the audience to explore more. These features not only made the comic more engaging but also showcased the potential of web-based storytelling.

As we worked on the project, we faced some challenges, such as coordinating schedules, balancing workload, and learning new software features. However, we overcame these obstacles by communicating effectively, delegating tasks, and seeking help when needed.
